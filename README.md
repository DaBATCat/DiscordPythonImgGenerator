# DiscordPythonImgGenerator
An image generator written in Python with Discord Integration cuz why not :D

You can give parameters to try around if you like to.
You can set values like `rgb 100 200 300` or `rgb 20 100` or `rgb 700`\
Or you can set limits for all parameters like `rgb limit 200`

And don't forget to replace your token =)
